title: Why Bloc? 
---

I started my Bloc Full-Stack Development class in August, and the most common thing I've heard is, "But aren't you already a developer?"

Well, maybe. But not the developer I want to be. Here's what I'm aiming to get out of being here: 

*  In every single job I've had, I've hit a wall when it comes to implementation of full-stack features. I either had to pair with another developer, or hand off my work entirely. I want to be able to work on the entire thing myself. 

* Before now I was entirely self-taught, and while I'm proud that I was able to be diligent about it up to this point, I think that back-end dev is something I want to approach with a little more structure. Working mostly independently is definitely something I enjoy doing, but it's nice to have a mentor that I can ping when things go sideways. 

* I love that Bloc has so many resources available for interviewing. I'm decent at what I do, but I'm not a great technical interviewer. Being in a position where I discuss my code and the decisions I've made around it every week with a more experienced dev has been really helpful.
