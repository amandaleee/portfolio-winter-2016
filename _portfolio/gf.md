## Explanation

From 2014 to 2016, I worked as a UX designer and front-end developer at GiveForward, a crowdfunding platform that aims to be the first place to turn when you or a loved one is in need. 


## Problem

Anyone who's been through a major medical event, lost a family member or pet, or brought home a new baby knows that these situations come with a lot of unexpected expenses. Some people are lucky to have insurance, savings accounts, or emergency funds; the rest of us approach these situations with uncertainty. 


## Solution

GiveForward is a platform where anyone can put together a fundraising page to ask for help during a challenging time. When you create a GiveForward page, you're not only setting up a fundraiser; you're creating a landing page for your community to rally around you and help you out with bringing meals, giving you rides, or babysitting. 

During 2014-2015, GF underwent a major redesign and replatforming, converting a PHP application almost entirely to Rails and Angular.js. I served as the primary liaison between development and UX design, building out interfaces in SLIM/HAML, CSS, and Javascript so they matched the UX specifications. I also reviewed UIs coded by other devs and helped the product managers with writing user stories and doing QA. 


## Results

During the entire duration of GiveForward's existence, the platform helped users to raise almost $200 million. 


## Conclusion

I'm honored and proud to have worked with this team of brilliant and conscientious people on a product that's helped so many users.
