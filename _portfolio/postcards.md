## Explanation

In 2016 I started a project of designing and sending postcards to whomever wanted one. It was an excuse to experiment a little with illustration and photo manipulation, and a way to keep in touch with friends. 


## Problem

I wanted to create a landing page where anyone could send me their address and email, and then receive a postcard the following month. 


## Solution

The quickest way I could think of to collect addresses was via a WordPress form, so I built a theme with a single page template, and then used Contact Form 7 as my form utility. I spent only a few hours on this site, and most of it was dedicated to the UI animation [I specifically wanted the form to move around like [http://codepen.io/stezu/pen/cmLrI](that bouncing DVD logo that we all love so much)]. When a user submits an address, I get an email notification. The emails are also stored in a database table for future reference. 

The background image of the site has changed intermittently to match the design of the most recent postcard I sent out. 


## Results

I've had over 60 people sign up over the course of the year after promoting the postcard project on my social media and verbally to friends. My policy has been that anyone who signs up gets a postcard for every month for the rest of the year. I've actually had a hard time keeping up with the design/printing/posting costs, so I'm running behind on sending them out on time, but the response has been great. 

## Conclusion

I'm going to keep this site live for awhile. Next year, I'm going to alter the project a little - the postcards will still go out, but less frequently. I'll probably revamp the UI of the site, or replatform it entirely off of WordPress
