## Explanation

DreamLab is a forthcoming dream-tracking application from cchange, a digital marketing agency.  A user logs on every morning and writes down what they dreamed about last night. They can also read other users' dreams, and respond to them with text, still images, or gifs. 

This landing page was built as a stopgap until the real application is finished. 

## Problem

DreamLab was set for release in December 2016. However, back in June 2016, the cchange development team was having a party for its clients, and the site was nowhere near ready. 

## Solution

We built this landing page to collect email addresses from interested parties and build buzz around the project. The mail form feeds into a MailChimp list, which we'll use to notify everyone who showed interest when we finish the application.

## Results

During the party, we got 15 signups, which is over a quarter of the attendees who were clients. 

## Conclusion

Since then, the DreamLab project has been tabled for the time being. I'm proud of the CSS animations though.
